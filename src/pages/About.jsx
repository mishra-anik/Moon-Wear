  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 mb-4">
    <strong>Moonwear</strong> is not just a clothing line — it’s a love letter to every Gen-Z girl who dresses for her vibe, not the crowd. Inspired by the soft chaos of <strong>Bewakoof</strong> and the budget-cool of <strong>Zudio</strong>, Moonwear is your everyday dose of dreamy fashion, curated with pastel energy and main-character feels.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Whether you’re styling for a cozy solo movie night or your “soft girl with edge” era, our pieces let you show up authentically — bold, soft, romantic, chaotic, whatever mood you’re in today. And yes, everything is made to be gifted too — because your bestie, sister, or that "she's so me" crush deserves the vibe.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 mb-4">
    🌸 <strong>We stand for:</strong><br/>
    • <em>Self-love over perfection</em><br/>
    • <em>Affordable style without the drama</em><br/>
    • <em>Fits that feel like hugs, not pressure</em><br/>
    • <em>Feminine energy with ✨real personality✨</em>
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg leading-8 text-gray-800 mb-4">
    All our clothes are handpicked for <strong>her</strong> — the Gen-Z girl who knows how to romanticize life, whether she’s journaling at a café, scrolling reels in her messy bun, or catching flights not feelings. We make fashion for every version of you: the soft, the sassy, the savage.
  </p>

  <p className="text-pink-700 font-semibold leading-8">
    No boring basics. No overthinking. Just ✨vibe-worthy clothes✨ that speak louder than your Pinterest board.
